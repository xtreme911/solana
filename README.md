# solana

THIS FILE MUST BE RUN AS ROOT. 

BEFORE YOU RUN IT YOU CAN SAVE SOME HASSLE BY JUST INSTALLING A FEW UBUNTU PACKAGES FIRST AS ROOT USER:

    INSTALL THE PACKAGES BY RUNNING THESE TWO COMMANDS AS ROOT:

    apt-get update

    apt-get install libssl-dev libudev-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev llvm clang make
                
THEN LOG IN AS YOUR SOLANA USERNAME OR USER su COMMAND LIKE THIS

    su <solana username>

THEN RUN THIS SCRIPT solbuild.sh AS YOUR SOLANA USERNAME

THE SOLANA USERNAME HAS TO BE THE SAME USERNAME THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR sol.service FILE 

YOUR sol.service FILE IS LOCATED AT /etc/systemd/system/sol.service

LOOK IN THE sol.service FILE AND USE THE USERNAME ON THE LINE THAT SAYS User=sol

SO IN THIS CASE THE USERNAME IS sol IN ALL LOWER CASE LETTERS
